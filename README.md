# 2015 Blue Ironhack (Submission One)
## Introduction
This is my first submission for the 2015 Blue Ironhack. It has been tested in Google Chrome on Mac OS X. Currently, my project uses Bootstrap (page layout and design), the Google Maps API, ((to display apartments in the future), and D3.js (to display an Aster Plot, which will be used to display a weighted score of a given apartment). The basic principle behind this hack is that the user will be able to select weights for the scores of each of the metrics that will be collected from data sources. The user weights will then be applied to a scoring algorithm to give an aggregate score to the user. This score is intended to aid the user in making a decision. This submission is still relatively buggy and will only serve as a basic skeleton of what is to come in my following submissions.

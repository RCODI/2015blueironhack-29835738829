# 2015 Blue Ironhack (Submission One)
## Introduction
This is my first submission for the 2015 Blue Ironhack. It has been tested in Google Chrome on Mac OS X. Currently, my project uses Bootstrap (page layout and design), the Google Maps API, ((to display apartments in the future), and D3.js (to display an Aster Plot, which will be used to display a weighted score of a given apartment). This submission is still relatively buggy and will only serve as a basic skeleton of what is to come in my following submissions.
